This project has been done to demonstrate the knowledge of web development acquired in **The Odin Project's JavaScript Basics portfolio**. Some fundamental topics like Events, Functions and DOM Manipulation were applied here.

In addition, other skills not related to the course have been applied in this project, such as the use of vectors (.svg files), grid layouts, and color theory. This with the aim of being able to expand my own knowledge and skills about web design.

# New Skiils Applied

- DOM Manipulation
- NodeList
- HTML Event Attribute
- JavaScript Events
- Transitions
- CSS Filters
